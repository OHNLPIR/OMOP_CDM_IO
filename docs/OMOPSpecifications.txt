- ConditionOccurrence:
	- condition_occurrence_[raw|cui|tui|{vocab}_text|{vocab}_code]: [DiseaseDisorderMention|SignSymptomMention]-> Covered Text + UMLS Concepts
	- date[]: TimeMentions in same Sentence as a [DiseaseDisorderMention|SignSymptomMention]
- DrugExposure:
	- drug_exposure_[raw|cui|tui|{vocab}_text|{vocab}_code]: MedicationMention -> Covered Text + UMLS Concepts
	- quantity: [UNMAPPED]
	- effectiveDrugDose: MeasurementAnnotations in the aggregate of all chunks holding the MedicationMention
	- date[]: TimeMentions in same Sentence as a MedicationMention
- Measurement:
	- value: MeasurementAnnotation->Covered Text->RegEx
	- measurement: MeasurementAnnotation->Covered Text
	- measurementid: [UNMAPPED] - OMOP Concept ID
	- operator_concept_id: [UNMAPPED]
- Person:
	- gender: [UNMAPPED]
	- ethnicity: [UNMAPPED]
	- locationid: [UNMAPPED]
	- age: HEADER->ACTIVITY_DTM - HEADER->DOB
	- limits: [UNMAPPED]
- UnstructuredObservation:
	- observation: Sentence->Does Not Contain [DiseaseDisorderMention|SignSymptomMention|MedicationMention|MeasurementAnnotation]
Date:
- begin_date: TimeMention->Covered Text->RegEx->Standardization
- end_date: TimeMention->Covered Text->RegEx->Standardization
- type: Determined based on RegEx rule used to match
- subject: Determined based on way it was found (discovered during ConditionOccurrence or DrugExposure mapping)
- timestamp: TimeMention->Covered Text->RegEx->Standardization to milliseconds
